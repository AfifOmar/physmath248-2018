    "In this class we will share lecture notes, assignments, problem sets, exams etc. in the same way software development teams would. In any such team it would be important not only to share pieces of code and other information but to attribute it, and to document when and where work has been added and changes have been made. In this way the team can review changes to a previous version, find bugs and easily use and relate to previous versions. Another advantage is that everybody can make changes to their own copy and later merge the changes back to a common code base. We will adopt the _distributed version control system_ [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)).\n",

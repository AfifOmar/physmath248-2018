    "**Homework:** unix command cheat sheet\n",
    "Familiarize yourself with the CLI, e.g. follow through online resources. Work in a team! Help each other! Look up each command using the `man` command, remind yourself what the command does, try it out, and create a brief reference page for yourself. It should look like this:\n",

    "- how many lines does it have?\n",
    "- search through the file for all incidences of a particular letter or string, and count them with 'wc'\n",
    "- use 'man' to look at the various options for 'grep', and then look for lines that do NOT have the letter 'e' in it.\n",
    "- go up one directory, and use 'du -h' on 1) the entire directory tree, and 2) just the new directory.\n",
    "- use 'man' to look at the options for 'rm', and then delete *ONLY* the entire directory you just created in one command.\n",
    "- use 'history' to see what you just did!\n",
